# Commit Message Guidelines

## Overview

When you work on software projects — especially in pairs or teams — everyone needs to understand **what changed and why**.  

A clear, consistent commit message helps you **communicate intent**, **track progress**, and **debug issues later**.  It is not just about Git syntax; it’s about developing a professional mindset for collaboration, accountability, and traceability.  

You’ll directly apply these practices in your **OOP CA project**, where your GitHub commit history forms part of your assessment.

## Why Commit Messages Matter

- Improve collaboration and traceability.  
- Simplify reviews and debugging.  
- Let others (and future you) understand reasoning.  
- Help generate automatic changelogs.  

Good commit messages are evidence of **clear thinking** and **responsible development**.

## Standard Structure

```
<type>: <short summary>

[optional longer explanation]
```

**Examples**
```
feat: add comparator for PlayerScore by descending order
fix: handle empty CSV rows during load
refactor: move validation logic to helper class
docs: update README with Stage 2 schema
```

### Common Commit Types

| Type | Used for… |
|:--|:--|
| `feat` | New feature or functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code restructure without changing behaviour |
| `test` | Adding or improving tests |
| `docs` | Documentation changes |
| `style` | Formatting or naming conventions |
| `chore` | Build tools or small maintenance updates |

## Writing Tips

- Use **imperative mood** (“Add feature” not “Added feature”).  
- Keep the first line under **72 characters**.  
- Write one logical change per commit.  
- Explain *why*, not just *what*, if not obvious from code.  
- Capitalise the first word and skip punctuation at the end.  

## Try It / Fix It

Rewrite these poor commit messages to follow best practice:

| Poor Example | Improved Example |
|:--|:--|
| “stuff fixed” | `fix: correct null pointer issue in Player constructor` |
| “new file” | `feat: add CsvLoader class for player data import` |
| “update” | `refactor: extract validation logic into Validator utility` |

**Challenge:**  
Write your own commit message describing one of your Stage 1 CA milestones.

## Reflection

How do clear commit messages improve teamwork and make debugging easier later?  
Write two sentences explaining how you’ll apply this habit during your OOP project.
