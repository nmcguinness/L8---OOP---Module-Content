# The DRY Principle in Java OOP

## Overview

The **DRY principle — Don’t Repeat Yourself** — helps you write Java code that’s clean, efficient, and easy to maintain.  

When code is duplicated, it quickly gets inconsistent: one version changes, the other doesn’t.  

Following DRY encourages **clarity**, **reuse**, and **structure**, which are essential in your **OOP CA** when designing entity classes, validation helpers, and report logic.

## Why DRY Matters

- Reduces duplication and inconsistency.  
- Makes maintenance and debugging easier.  
- Simplifies testing and validation.  
- Encourages modular, reusable design.

## Before and After Example

**Before (duplication):**
```java
if (price < 0 || price > 999) System.out.println("Invalid price");
if (discount < 0 || discount > 50) System.out.println("Invalid discount");
```

**After (DRY refactor):**
```java
private boolean isValidRange(double value, double min, double max) {
    return value >= min && value <= max;
}
```
Now, one helper method handles all range checks.

## Common DRY Techniques

| Technique | Example | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Helper methods** | `isValidName(name)` | Centralise repeated validation logic. |
| **Constants** | `private static final int MAX_SCORE = 100;` | Avoid hard-coded numbers or strings. |
| **Utility classes** | `DataUtils`, `Validator` | Keep shared logic reusable. |
| **Inheritance/Composition** | `BaseEntity` class | Move shared behaviour to a common class. |

## Try It / Fix It

1. Identify duplication in this snippet:
   ```java
   if (score > 100) System.out.println("Too high");
   if (level > 100) System.out.println("Too high");
   ```
   Refactor it to apply DRY.

2. Review your CA code: where could two similar methods be combined?

## Reflection

How does applying DRY make your project easier to debug and maintain?  
Write one example from your current CA where duplication could cause future errors.
