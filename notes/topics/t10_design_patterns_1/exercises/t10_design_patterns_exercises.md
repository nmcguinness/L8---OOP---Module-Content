# Design Patterns I — Exercises

> These exercises build directly on the **Design Patterns I** notes.  
> This set focuses on **Strategy** and **Command**, including two exercises where you combine both patterns in the same mini-system.

## Ground rules

- Keep selection logic out of your “core” classes (no giant `if`/`switch` blocks in the wrong place).
- No `instanceof` checks to decide behaviour.
- Print small outputs in `run()` so you can quickly verify behaviour.

## How to run

Each exercise assumes a package like:

```java
t10_design_patterns_1.exercises.exNN
````

Create a class `Exercise` in that package with a static entry point:

```java
package t10_design_patterns_1.exercises.ex01;

public class Exercise {
    public static void run() {
        // call your methods here; print results for quick checks
    }
}
```

## Exercise 01 — Combat AI attack behaviour (Strategy)

**Objective:** Build a tiny combat model where an `Enemy` can attack at a given distance, but the **rules for how damage is computed** live outside the `Enemy` class.

Your finished solution should let you:
- create multiple enemies using the **same** `Enemy` class
- give each enemy a different `AttackStrategy` (e.g., melee vs ranged)
- call `enemy.attack(distanceMeters)` and get damage back based on that strategy’s rules

In other words: `Enemy` should *not* contain “if melee then … else if ranged then …”. Instead, the `Enemy` delegates damage calculation to the strategy object you supplied. In `run()`, you should be able to show the *same distances* producing different results for different enemy strategies.


**Context (software + games):**

* **Software dev:** avoid giant conditional logic for “modes” by encapsulating behaviour.
* **Games dev:** enemies often share the same base stats but differ in combat behaviour (melee, ranged, cautious, aggressive).

### What you are building

A tiny combat model where:

* an enemy has a **base damage**
* an enemy has an **AttackStrategy**
* the strategy decides the damage based on distance

### Required API

Implement these types:

```java
interface AttackStrategy {
    int computeDamage(int baseDamage, int distanceMeters);
}

class Enemy {
    public Enemy(String name, int baseDamage, AttackStrategy strategy) { }
    public String getName() { return ""; }
    public int attack(int distanceMeters) { return 0; }
}
```

### Tasks

1. Create an interface `AttackStrategy` with:
   `int computeDamage(int baseDamage, int distanceMeters)`
2. Implement two strategies:

   * `MeleeAttack`: returns `baseDamage + 5` only when `distanceMeters <= 2` (else return 0)
   * `RangedAttack`: returns `baseDamage` only when `distanceMeters <= 10` (else return 0)
3. Create an `Enemy` class that stores `name`, `baseDamage`, and an `AttackStrategy`.
4. Add `int attack(int distanceMeters)` on `Enemy` that delegates to the strategy.
5. In `run()`, create one melee enemy and one ranged enemy and print damage at distances `1`, `5`, `12`.

### Done when…

* Your `Enemy` class contains **no** “mode selection” logic (`if`/`switch` on enemy type).
* Damage gating (distance checks) is inside the strategies.
* You can swap strategy objects without changing `Enemy` code.

        int[] distances = new int[] { 1, 5, 12 };

        for (int d : distances)

            System.out.println(skeleton.getName() + " at " + d + "m: " + skeleton.attack(d));

    {
        return _strategy.computeDamage(_baseDamage, distanceMeters);
    }
}
```

## Exercise 02 — Pricing rules (Strategy)

**Objective:** Build a checkout/pricing component where the **final price calculation** is fully controlled by a `PriceStrategy`.

Your finished solution should let you:
- take a `basePrice` and produce a `finalPrice` using a chosen pricing rule
- swap pricing rules without changing the `Checkout` class (only swap the strategy object)
- keep “special business rules” (like a minimum price floor) inside the strategy that owns that rule

In `run()`, you should be able to compute prices for the same base value using multiple strategies and clearly see different results (including a case that triggers the “never below €5.00” behaviour).

**Context (software + games):**

* **Software dev:** pricing rules evolve constantly (discounts, promos, minimum price floors).
* **Games dev:** in-game stores often apply different pricing rules (membership discounts, events, bundles).

### What you are building

A mini checkout that can swap pricing rules by passing a different strategy object.

### Required API

```java
interface PriceStrategy {
    double finalPrice(double basePrice);
}

class Checkout {
    public Checkout(PriceStrategy pricing) { }
    public double price(double basePrice) { return 0.0; }
}
```

### Tasks

1. Create `PriceStrategy` with:
   `double finalPrice(double basePrice)`
2. Implement strategies:

   * `NoDiscount`: returns base price
   * `StudentDiscount`: 10% off
   * `BlackFridayDiscount`: 30% off, but never below €5.00
3. Create `Checkout` that stores a `PriceStrategy` and exposes:
   `double price(double basePrice)`
4. In `run()`, show results for base prices `10.00` and `4.00` using all three strategies.

### Done when…

* `Checkout` contains **no** `if`/`switch` logic for which discount to apply.
* Your “never below €5.00” clamp rule lives inside `BlackFridayDiscount`.
* You can add another pricing strategy without changing `Checkout`.

        Checkout none = new Checkout(new NoDiscount());
        Checkout student = new Checkout(new StudentDiscount());
        Checkout bf = new Checkout(new BlackFridayDiscount());

        for (double p : basePrices)
        {
            System.out.println("Base " + p + " -> none: " + none.price(p));
            System.out.println("Base " + p + " -> student: " + student.price(p));

        return discounted;
    }

    {
        return _pricing.finalPrice(basePrice);
    }
}
```

## Exercise 03 — Execute a task with a policy (Strategy + Command)

**Objective:** Build a mini job runner where:
- a **Command** represents “a piece of work that can be triggered”
- a **Strategy** represents “the policy for how that work is executed”

Your finished solution should let you:
- define one `Task` (the thing that ultimately runs)
- execute the *same* task under different policies (e.g., fast vs safe)
- keep the policy decision out of the task itself (the task should not decide whether it runs validated or unchecked)

In `run()`, you should execute the same task twice and show different behaviour/output depending on whether you chose a “fast/unchecked” execution strategy or a “safe/validated” execution strategy.

**Context (software + games):**

* **Software dev:** run jobs with different policies (fast vs safe, strict vs permissive).
* **Games dev:** run gameplay actions under different rules (e.g., debug mode vs release mode).

### What you are building

A task executor where the same “execute task” command can run under different execution strategies.

### Required API

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

interface TaskExecutionStrategy {
    void execute(Task task);
}

class ExecuteTaskCommand implements Command {
    public ExecuteTaskCommand(Task task, TaskExecutionStrategy strategy) { }
}
```

### Tasks

1. Create a `Task` with:

   * `String name`
   * `void validate()` prints `Validating: <name>`
   * `void run()` prints `Running: <name>`
   * `void runUnchecked()` prints `Running unchecked: <name>`
2. Create `TaskExecutionStrategy` with `void execute(Task task)`.
3. Implement:

   * `FastExecution`: uses `task.runUnchecked()`
   * `SafeExecution`: uses `task.validate()` then `task.run()`
4. Create `Command` with `void execute()`.
5. Create `ExecuteTaskCommand(Task task, TaskExecutionStrategy strategy)`.
6. In `run()`, execute the same task twice (fast then safe).

### Done when…

* The command does not contain selection logic; it just delegates to its strategy.
* You can add another strategy (e.g., “DryRunExecution”) without changing the command.
* The same `Task` can be executed in multiple ways by swapping strategy objects.

    }
}
```

## Exercise 04 — MacroCommand (commands as building blocks)

**Objective:** Build a `MacroCommand` that behaves like a normal `Command`, but internally runs **a list of commands in order**.

Your finished solution should let you:
- create small commands that each perform one step (here: printing a message)
- combine them into a macro that represents a larger workflow
- execute the macro with one call to `execute()`, producing the same order of steps you added

In `run()`, calling `macro.execute()` once should produce a clear multi-step output (e.g., `start → validate → execute → done`). The key requirement is that the macro is treated just like any other command, meaning it implements the same interface.

**Context (software + games):**

* **Software dev:** “apply preset” or “run workflow” made of smaller steps.
* **Games dev:** combo actions, scripted sequences, or tool pipelines (export, bake, package).

### What you are building

A `MacroCommand` that contains multiple commands and executes them in order.

### Required API

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

class MacroCommand implements Command {
    public void add(Command command) { }
}
```

### Tasks

1. Create `Command` with `void execute()`.
2. Implement `PrintCommand(String message)` that prints the message.
3. Implement `MacroCommand` that contains a `List<Command>`.
4. `MacroCommand.execute()` must execute all inner commands in order.
5. In `run()`, create a macro that prints `start`, then 2–3 steps, then `done`.

### Done when…

* `MacroCommand` implements the same `Command` interface as the commands it contains.
* You can pass a `MacroCommand` anywhere a `Command` is expected.
* The macro prints messages in the same order they were added.

## Exercise 05 — Undoable commands (undo stack)

**Objective:** Build an undo system where each user action is represented as an object that can both:
- apply the change (`execute()`)
- reverse the same change (`undo()`)

Your finished solution should let you:
- apply multiple changes to a shared receiver object (a `Counter`)
- push each executed command onto a history stack
- undo the *most recent* command(s) in reverse order (LIFO)
- verify that state returns to the correct previous values after each undo

In `run()`, you should demonstrate a sequence like “+5, +2, +10” and then undo the last two actions, showing the counter stepping back correctly. The undo logic should not “guess” — it should be the exact inverse of what was executed.

**Context (software + games):**

* **Software dev:** undo/redo in editors, admin tools, form builders.
* **Games dev:** tool history, level editor actions, replayable input/actions.

### What you are building

A `Counter` that can be changed via undoable commands and reverted using a history stack.

### Required API

```java
interface UndoableCommand {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}

class AddNumberCommand implements UndoableCommand {
    public AddNumberCommand(Counter counter, int amount) { }
}
```

### Tasks

1. Create `Counter` with:

   * private field `_value`
   * `void add(int amount)`
   * `int getValue()`
2. Create `UndoableCommand` with `execute()` and `undo()`.
3. Implement `AddNumberCommand(Counter counter, int amount)`:

   * `execute()` adds the amount
   * `undo()` subtracts the same amount
4. In `run()`:

   * Create `ArrayDeque<UndoableCommand> history`
   * Execute: add 5, add 2, add 10 (counter should be 17)
   * Undo last two (counter should be 5)
   * Print counter after each step

### Done when…

* Undo reverses exactly what execute did.
* Undo order is LIFO (stack behaviour).
* Your history structure does not throw exceptions for normal usage.

## Exercise 06 — Café order tickets dispatcher (Command + Strategy)

**Objective:** Build a simple order-ticket dispatcher where:
- each ticket is processed via a **Command** (so tickets can be queued and executed later)
- the processing behaviour is selected via a **Strategy** (so different tickets can be handled differently)

In `run()`, you should enqueue multiple tickets that trigger each policy and show distinct outputs (`IMMEDIATE MAKE ...`, `VALIDATED MAKE ...`, `REJECT ...`, `TRAINING ...`). The important part is that the queue does not contain the selection logic — it simply runs commands — and the strategy selection is done in one place (the selector).

**Context:**

You are building a tiny “order processing” system for a café. Orders arrive from different places (counter staff, self-service kiosk, mobile app). The café wants a consistent way to handle these orders without copying logic everywhere.

Instead of processing orders immediately, we represent each order as a ticket and add it to a queue. Later, the kitchen/barista station processes tickets in order.

To keep behaviour flexible, the café uses different processing policies:
- Some tickets can be processed immediately.
- Big / expensive tickets must be validated first (to reduce mistakes).
- Training-mode tickets should not create real orders — they should only print what would happen.

This problem is perfect for Command + Strategy together:

Command = “this is a unit of work that can be queued”
Strategy = “this is the policy for how that work should run”

Typical use cases include the following:
- Queueing: During a rush, tickets pile up and are processed FIFO.
- Validation: Large orders should be double-checked (e.g., “12 coffees + 6 sandwiches”) so you don’t waste stock.
- Training mode: New staff can practise entering orders without actually sending them to the kitchen.


### What you are building

A tiny order-ticket system for a café:

* Orders arrive from the counter, kiosk, or app.
* Each order becomes a **ticket** and is queued FIFO.
* A selector chooses how each ticket is processed:

  * normal tickets process immediately
  * big orders are validated first
  * training tickets do a dry-run print only

### Required API

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

interface OrderProcessingStrategy {
    void process(OrderTicket ticket);
}

class ProcessingPolicySelector {
    public OrderProcessingStrategy select(OrderTicket ticket) { return null; }
}

class TicketQueue {
    public void add(Command command) { }
    public void processAll() { }
}
```

### Tasks

#### Part A — model the ticket

1. Create `OrderTicket` with:

   * `int ticketId`
   * `String description` (e.g., `"2 lattes, 1 muffin"`)
   * `double totalEuro`
   * `int itemCount`
2. Add `boolean isValid()` with rules:

   * description must not be blank
   * `totalEuro > 0`
   * `itemCount > 0`

#### Part B — define processing strategies

3. Create `OrderProcessingStrategy` with: `void process(OrderTicket ticket)`
4. Implement:

   * `ImmediateProcess`: prints `MAKE <id> <description> (€<total>)`
   * `ValidatedProcess`: if invalid prints `REJECT <id> invalid` and returns; else prints `MAKE ...`
   * `DryRunTraining`: prints `TRAINING <id> would make: <description> (€<total>)`

#### Part C — command + queue

5. Create `Command` with `void execute()`.
6. Create `ProcessTicketCommand(OrderTicket ticket, OrderProcessingStrategy strategy)`.
7. Create `TicketQueue` using `Queue<Command>` (`ArrayDeque`) with `add(...)` and `processAll()`.

#### Part D — strategy selection

8. Create `ProcessingPolicySelector` with: `OrderProcessingStrategy select(OrderTicket ticket)`
9. Rules:

   * If description contains `"training"` (case-insensitive), use `DryRunTraining`
   * Else if `totalEuro >= 30` or `itemCount >= 6`, use `ValidatedProcess`
   * Else use `ImmediateProcess`

#### Part E — demo in `run()`

10. Create 4 tickets:

* normal small order
* invalid order (blank description or total 0)
* training-mode ticket (description contains “training”)
* large/high-risk order (forces validated)

Enqueue a command for each ticket, then process the queue.

### Done when…

* Strategy selection happens in `ProcessingPolicySelector`, not inside the queue or command.
* The queue keeps processing even after one ticket is rejected.
* You can add another processing strategy without changing the queue.
