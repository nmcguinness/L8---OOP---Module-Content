# Equality & Hashing — Exercises

> These exercises build directly on the **Equality & Hashing — Foundations** notes. Work from top to bottom. 

> Most tasks include small, checkable outputs. Use the provided method signatures and add tiny tests in `main` or `Exercise.run()`.

> Hints and snippets you can reuse are in the notes (e.g., 31‑multiplier pattern, `Objects.hash`, and `Math.floorMod`).

## How to run
Each exercise assumes a package like:
```
t02_equality_hashing.exercises.exNN
```
Create a class `Exercise` in that package with a static entry point:
```java
package t02_equality_hashing.exercises.ex01;

public final class Exercise {
    public static void run() {
        // call your methods here; print results for quick checks
    }
}
```
Call `Exercise.run()` from your `Main`, as shown in the repo README.

## Exercise 01 — Identity vs Equality (warm‑up)
**Objective:** Distinguish identity (`==`) from value equality (`equals`).  
**Description:** Create **two distinct** `String` objects with the same text and compare using both `==` and `.equals(...)`. Summarise the difference in your own words.
- In `run()`:
  ```java
  String a = new String("hello");
  String b = new String("hello");
  System.out.println(a == b);       // expect false
  System.out.println(a.equals(b));  // expect true
  // write 1–2 lines explaining identity vs value equality
  ```

## Exercise 02 — The equals/hashCode Contract
**Objective:** State and apply the contract correctly.  
**Description:** Write a short bullet list of the contract (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, consistent, non‑null). Provide a tiny counterexample that **breaks symmetry** and explain why it’s dangerous.
- Deliverables:
  - 3–5 bullet points describing the contract.
  - 5–10 lines of Java (or pseudocode) that break symmetry, plus a 1‑sentence risk explanation.

## Exercise 03 — Hand Hash (string → number, polynomial)
**Objective:** Compute a rolling (polynomial) hash by hand.  
**Description:** Using base `b = 31`, compute the hash for `S = "CAB"` step‑by‑step and report the final value.
- Work:
  ```text
  h0 = 0
  h1 = 31*h0 + 'C'(67) = ?
  h2 = 31*h1 + 'A'(65) = ?
  h3 = 31*h2 + 'B'(66) = ?  // final
  ```
- Report `h3`.

---

## Exercise 04 — Hand Hash (object fields → number)
**Objective:** Combine field hashes consistently with equality.  
**Description:** Given `hash("C1") = 20123` and `hash("a@x.com") = 881234`, compute:
```
h = 31 * hash("C1") + hash("a@x.com")
```
- Then, in 2–3 sentences, explain why the **same fields** used in `equals` must be used in `hashCode` and why immutability helps.

---

## Exercise 05 — From Hash to Bucket Index
**Objective:** Map a hash to a valid array index using modulo and masking.  
**Description:** Using your `h3` from Exercise 03, compute indices for table sizes `m = 16` and `m = 32` using both `h % m` and `h & (m-1)` (assume `h ≥ 0`). If `h` could be negative, show the expression with `Math.floorMod(h, m)`.
- Quick checks:
  ```java
  int m16 = 16, m32 = 32;
  int idx16_mod = h % m16;
  int idx16_mask = h & (m16 - 1);
  int idx32_mod = h % m32;
  int idx32_mask = h & (m32 - 1);
  int idxSafe = Math.floorMod(h, m16);
  // Print all indices to verify
  ```

## Exercise 06 — Implement equals/hashCode (class)
**Objective:** Write consistent overrides based on identifying fields.  
**Description:** Implement a `final class Customer` with fields `id` and `email`. Two customers are equal if their **id** is equal. Implement `hashCode` consistently. Add a tiny `main` (or `run`) that shows two equal customers produce `equals == true` and equal hash codes.
- Skeleton:
  ```java
  public final class Customer {
      private final String id;
      private final String email;
      // ctor, getters

      @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { /* id-based */ }
      @Override public int hashCode() { /* Objects.hash(id) */ }
  }
  ```

## Exercise 07 — Collision Reasoning (toy hash)
**Objective:** Reason about collisions and hash quality.  
**Description:** For the **toy** hash `h_sum(S) = sum of ASCII codes`, give **two different** 3‑letter strings that produce the **same** result. Show your working. In one sentence, explain why this toy hash is a poor real‑world choice.

---

## Exercise 08 — Mutability Pitfall
**Objective:** Explain why changing the fields that are used to generate a hash is dangerous.  
**Description:** Create a class `Tag` with a mutable `name` and write `equals`/`hashCode` based on `name`. In 1–2 sentences, explain what could go wrong if this object were used in a hashed lookup and `name` changes after insertion (we’ll implement collections later).
